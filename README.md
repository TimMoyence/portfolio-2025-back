commande to add new migration :

```bash
npm run migration:new --name=TheNameInCamelCase
```

## Project setup

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## API documentation

Swagger UI is available once the server is running:

1. Start the API (for example `pnpm run start:dev`).
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/docs` (or `/${SWAGGER_PATH}` if you override the path) to explore the automatically generated OpenAPI specification.

The documentation is backed by DTO metadata, so request/response shapes always stay in sync with the codebase.

### Auth & Users

- `POST /auth/login` — authenticate with email/password and receive a JWT plus the sanitized user payload.
- `PATCH /auth/change-password` — change a user's password by providing the current and new password (hashed transparently before persisting).
- `GET /users` & CRUD routes — manage users; all responses omit sensitive hashes.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```
